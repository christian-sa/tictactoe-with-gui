# Tic-Tac-Toe

I expanded my [previous](https://github.com/christian-sa/tictactoe-with-minimax) Tic-Tac-Toe 
game by revamping how the game is played: It now features a GUI I created with JavaFX.
Additionally most of the styling was done with CSS.

### To do:
- Implement Console Log feature in the application to look at past events
  > Right now everything is being printed straight to the IDEs console
- Improve documentation, add more comments  
- Package files in .jar and wrap in .exe for ease of use

### Example:
